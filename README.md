# TRT analysis
A python package with different methods for the interpretation of thermal response tests. The goal of this package is to bundle all available methodologies for TRT analysis so the user can easily compare one to another.

Currently the following methods are implemented:
- Traditional ILS, based on the work of (Gehlin, 2002)
- GA-TRT, based on the work of (Focaccia et al., 2013)

## Requirements

## Getting started

## Citation
If you use this python package, please cite it using the citation below.

Next to that, please cite the work of the author from which you used the methodology.

### Traditional ILS

## Collaborate
There are many different methods for the analysis of TRT measurement data. If you have developed a method of your own and you want to include it in this package, you are encourage to create a PR.
