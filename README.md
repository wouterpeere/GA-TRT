pyTRT is a python package with different methods for the interpretation of thermal response tests. The goal of this
package is to
bundle all available methodologies for TRT analysis so the user can easily compare one to another.

Currently the following methods are implemented:

- Traditional ILS, based on the work of (Gehlin, 2002)
- GA-TRT, based on the work of (Focaccia et al., 2013)

## Requirements

This code is tested with Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 and requires the following libraries (the versions mentioned
are the ones with which the code is tested)

- numpy >= 1.26.4
- pandas >= 1.4.3

For the tests

- pytest >= 7.1.2

## Collaborate

There are many different methods for the analysis of TRT measurement data. If you have developed a method of your own
and you want to include it in this package, you are encouraged to share this. Please follow the contribution workflow.
